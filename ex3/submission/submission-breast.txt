- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
- Python Version: Python 3.8
- Random State: 11776836

The learning data was split into a 1/3 test-set and 2/3 training-set. I trained 4 different algorithms.
I used my matriculation number as random state.

- k-NN (2 neighbours)
- k-NN (4 neighbours)
- k-NN (6 neighbours)
- Decision Tree (None max features)
- Decision Tree (sqrt max features)
- Decision Tree (log2 max features)
- SVM (SVC)
- Random Forests (10 trees, `sqrt` max features)
- Random Forests (10 trees, `log2` max features)
- Random Forests (50 trees, `sqrt` max features)
- Random Forests (50 trees, `log2` max features)
- Random Forests (100 trees, `sqrt` max features)
- Random Forests (100 trees, `log` max features)

SVM achieved the best results for me. SVM was used with the default settings and SVC.

- Algorithm: SVM

I achieved an f1-score of 1.0 with the learning data-set, which is perfect. Then i retrained SVM and used it
on the test-set.
