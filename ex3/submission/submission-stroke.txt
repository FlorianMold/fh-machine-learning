- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
- IDE: Pycharm
- Python Version: Python 3.8
- Random State: 11776836

The learning data was split into a 1/3 test-set and 2/3 training-set. I trained 4 different algorithms.
I used my matriculation number as random state.

- k-NN (2 neighbours)
- k-NN (4 neighbours)
- k-NN (6 neighbours)
- Decision Tree (None max features)
- Decision Tree (sqrt max features)
- Decision Tree (log2 max features)
- SVM (SVC)
- Random Forests (10 trees, `sqrt` max features)
- Random Forests (10 trees, `log2` max features)
- Random Forests (50 trees, `sqrt` max features)
- Random Forests (50 trees, `log2` max features)
- Random Forests (100 trees, `sqrt` max features)
- Random Forests (100 trees, `log` max features)

k-NN (6 neighbours) achieved the best results. An accuracy score of k-NN (6 neighbours) 0.9573 and a f1-score of 0.9417 was achieved.

I chose the algorithm with the best score, either f1 or accuracy.

- Algorithm: kNN

I retrained k-NN (6 neighbours) and used it on the test-set.
