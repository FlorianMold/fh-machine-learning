# Exercise 1 - Describe a Machine Learning task

In this task, you shall describe a problem that you would like to solve with supervised Machine Learning (regression or classification; if you don't find anything in that area, also other Data Mining/unsupervised approaches are ok).

The focus is on describing what the problem is, and how it can be formulated as a machine learning task. Further, describe what data is generally available to solve the task, and what of that data can actually be captured, and how the data might need to be treated before. Also, try to analyse what data could be gathered in the future to improve the solution to your problem.

Follow the data mining process described in the first lecture.

Your report shall be 2-3 pages long.
